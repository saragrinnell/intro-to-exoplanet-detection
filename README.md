# intro-to-exoplanet-detection
A few lines of code to help you get started lookin through data in order to find your very own exoplanet!

step 1- find a star on the MAST archive. 
a)You can do this by selecting the MAST portal option towards the bottom half of the site
b) once you're on the MAST portal, select MAST catalogues from the "select a collection" menu
c)select TESS CTL v0.8 from the "mission" menu
d)select "advanced search" play with the filters until you have the option to click "search"
e) once you've hit search there should be a list of stars, open another tab for the MAST portal and then enter the star ID beginning with TIC into the search bar. for example, you'd enter TIC	 239183687
f) go through the list until you've found a timeseries file ending in tp (this takes a hot minute)
g) once you've found the file through your list, extract it into a folder of your choice and after you've done that, select the tp file and click "copy as path"
h) you can now plug it into the code provided in this repository, happy planet hunting!
